Well, that's what I tend to think about this space, some interesting information that I think will help someone, that well, helped me.

# Abit about Kanji

I love Tech. And Tech turns me on. Not in the literal since, but it tingles my
nerves and releases the happy hormones (**Dopamine**, yes that is what it is called. It is
an actual name.) and I am hoping that through the few tidbits here and there, it will be worth while your time. I will throw some shade here and there, don't mind if I do 😏.
